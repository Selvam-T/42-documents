Content-Encoding
----------------

- The "Content-Encoding" header field indicates 
	- what content codings have been applied to the representation, 
	beyond those inherent in the media type, 
	- and thus what decoding mechanisms have to be applied in order to obtain data 
	in the media type referenced by the Content-Type header field.
	
- Content-Encoding is primarily used to allow a representation's data 
	to be compressed without losing the identity of its underlying media type
	
- Example:
	Content-Encoding: gzip
	
- If one or more encodings have been applied to a representation
	- list the content codings in the order in which they were applied.
	
- the representation is defined in terms of the coded form, 
	- and all other metadata about the representation is about the coded form 
	unless otherwise noted in the metadata definition.
	
- If the media type includes an inherent encoding, such as a data format that is always 
	compressed, then that encoding would not be restated in Content-Encoding
	
- An origin server MAY respond with a status code of 415 (Unsupported Media Type) 
if a representation in the request message has a content coding that is not acceptable.


Content codings

Gzip, Compress, Deflate

Content-Encoding vs Transfer-Encoding
-------------------------------------

Content-Encoding: gzip

	- The content (e.g., a file or response body) is compressed using the GZIP format 
	before being sent.
	- The recipient (client or intermediary) is expected to decompress the body to retrieve 
	the original content.
	
Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked

	- The data is compressed at the transport level to reduce transmission size.
	- This compression occurs before applying chunked encoding.
	
	and,
	- The compressed data is split into chunks for streaming, typically 
	when the server doesn't know the total size of the response in advance.
	
What does it mean if it has both Content-Encoding: gzip and Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The server compresses the original content using GZIP (Content-Encoding: gzip).

- Then, it applies another layer of GZIP compression for transmission (Transfer-Encoding: gzip).

- Finally, it breaks the double-compressed data into chunks for streaming (Transfer-Encoding: chunked).


- The client processes the Transfer-Encoding in reverse:
- The client then processes the Content-Encoding

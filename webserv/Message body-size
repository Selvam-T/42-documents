How to determine message body size
----------------------------------
1) When a message does not have a Transfer-Encoding header field, 
	a Content-Length header field can provide the anticipated size,
	as a decimal number of octets, for potential content.
	
2) For messages that do include content, 
	the Content-Length field value provides the framing information necessary 
	for determining where the data (and message) ends. 

  For messages that do not include content, 
  	the Content-Length indicates the size of the selected representation.
  
  	
Psuedo code for determining body length (based on RFC 9112, 6.3)
----------------------------------------------------------------

if (Transfer-Encoding header is present) {
    if (Transfer-Encoding is "chunked") {
        read body as a series of chunks until a zero-length chunk is found
    } else {
        // Unsupported transfer encoding
        throw error: "Unsupported Transfer-Encoding"
    }
} else if (Content-Length header is present) {
    content_length = parse Content-Length header value
    if (content_length < 0) {
        throw error: "Invalid Content-Length"
    }
    read content_length bytes from the message body
} else if (Request is a GET, HEAD, DELETE, or CONNECT method) {
    // No message body for these request types
    body_length = 0
} else if (Response has status code 1xx, 204, or 304) {
    // No message body for these response types
    body_length = 0
} else if (Response uses HTTP/1.1 and has no Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding) {
    // Read until the connection is closed (HTTP/1.1 without body delimiters)
    read until connection close
} else {
    // Unknown situation, throw an error or close connection
    throw error: "Unable to determine body length"
}

questions for Team:

10) MessageRouter::cgiHandler() / Parent process has write() which can be blocking,
	should I make pipefd[] non blocking??
	
9) If header size > 8192 send error and disconnect.
	Similarly has size limit for file size ?

8) Implement Transfer-encoding based body extraction.

7) In HTTPServer::start()
	215: when reading body, if bytes read is -1 or != body size
		throw error?

6)  In HTTPServer::start()
	if ((fcntl()) failed then do I continue without NON-BLOCKING client_fd?

5) In HTTPServer::start()
	185: close(epoll_fd); 
	186: continue;
	will lead to undefined behaviour, because we continue in loop after closing epoll_fd
	
4) In HTTPServer::start()
	event_count = epoll_wait(epoll_fd, events, 1024, 30000); --> this is not non blocking?
	block for 30 secs??

3) Is it possible to send form-data to server compressed in gzip, in POST method?
	Such that, content-encoding : gzip
	So do we have to decompress gzip to extract form data?
	
2) Transfer-Encoding and content-Encoding (both) ?
	

1) If 'host' is not provided with 'abs_path', for all methods, in the Header of HTTP Request,
	then return '400 bad request'? 
		
		
Useful tips from Bing
---------------------
1) HTTPie for web


2) hostname on local machine example: 

	a) c1r4s5.42singapore.sg

	b) subdomain: c1r4s5
 	  domain: 42singapore.sg

	c) how to find on linux cmdline 
	   $> hostname -f
	   or
	   $> dnsdomainname
	   or
	   $> cat /etc/hostname
	   or
	   $> cat /etc/hosts
	   
3) curl - command line tool to make HTTP requests

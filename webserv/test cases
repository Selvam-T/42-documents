TEST CASES

1) Delete: Try to delete a file with no read, write or execute permission.

	If file does not have read permission, 
	file.open() returns false.
	
	So using file.open() to check if file exists is problematic.

2) Can I use telnet to send HTTP request with Transfer-Encoding: Chunked, and expect
	the Server application to handle it?
	
3) Transfer-Encoding: chunked
	nc localhost 8080 <<EOF
	POST / HTTP/1.1
	Host: localhost:8080
	Transfer-Encoding: chunked

	8
	chunks.
	0

	EOF
	
4) wrk - a HTTP benchmarking tool from https://github.com/wg/wrk
	to generate significant load when run on a single multi-core CPU

>	git clone https://github.com/wg/wrk.git
	
	Basic Usage -
>	wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html
	
	This runs a benchmark for 30 seconds, using 12 threads, 
	and keeping 400 HTTP connections open.
	
5) How does the developer handle race condition that may arise from concurrent
	GET and DELETE request for same document, same time ?
	
	Answer: In our implementation, epoll_wait() will process one event at a time,
	So, GET and DELETE request will not be executed concurrently.

Variables:

Player Facing direction: N S W E in radians.
The number of rays cast = number of pixels along the width of the game screen.

What is a ray? 

How is ray 1 different from ray 2? (Assume there is 100 pixels along the width).

How does ray advance along the path of its direction?

How do I determine what point of the cell wall the ray strikes?

In what units are the sides of a wall divided?

Check every cell value along the direction of the ray.
	1) which axis of the cell did the ray strike?
		Top and Bottom are y axis
		Left and Right are x axis
	2) which side of the cell did the ray strike?
		If y axis (Top or Bottom)
		If x axis (Left or Right)

Raycasting: The components of the DDA algorithm include -
    	1)Start and end points of the line or ray.
    	2)Step increments for x and y coordinates.
    	3)Calculation of the distance and direction to step through the grid.
    	
How do I represent the camera plane vector?

The relationship between Player facing direction and the camera plane vector?

If I rotate the Player facing direction, how do I rotate along the camera plane vector?

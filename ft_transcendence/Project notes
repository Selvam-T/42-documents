ðŸŸ§ Preamable
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- mandatory part 
- series of modules on various topics

- each module and mandatory element contains technical constraints 
  you cannot bypass.

- select the topics you like, but not technologies you like.

- consider several possible strategies, think about your design, 
  before starting coding anything.
  
- Some modules may depend on others, 
  some modules may conflict with others.
  
- Ft_transcendence will bring many doubts and requires a lot of difficult decisions

- Your project management and team management choices will strongly impact
  your timeline and results

  
ðŸŸ§ Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- user interface 
- real-time multiplayer capabilities
- to play Pong with all your friends

Part 1) mandatory guidelines / minimum requirement / small portion of the final grade
Part 2) additional modules / replace / complement the mandatory part.
  
ðŸŸ§ Prohibtion questions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) libraries or tools is prohibited ðŸ”’
	- if it provides immediate, complete solution for an entire feature or module
   	  small libraries or tools is allowed
   	- to solve simple, unique task representing a subcomponent of a large feature
   	  or module
	
2) third party library and tools
	- consult 'can', 'must', 'use' guideline

ðŸŸ§ Evaluation guidelines 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
- library or tools
  	- justify use of library or tools that is not explicitly approved
  	- is it in contradiction with the project's constraints?
  	
- EVALUATOR will take responsibility in determining the legitimacy of specific library or tool

ðŸŸ£ Setup SSH in Visual Studio running on host machine to connect to Virtual Machine 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- VS code running on host machine, will access Virtual machine to pull files using SSH
- Virtual Machine - settings/ Network/ Port Forwarding
	ssh		TCP	0.0.0.0		2222	0.0.0.0		22
	transcendence	TCP	0.0.0.0		4242	0.0.0.0		4242
- configuration of SSH on host and virtual machine, I don't remember
- setting up of SSH connection to virtual machine, I don't remember

ðŸŸ¢ AI Prediction, data and machine learning approach
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<> Model needs to predict where and when the ball will arrive, so the paddle
  can move accordingly.

<> This is a deterministic game, where the outcome is entirely determined by 
  the initial conditions and the rules, with no random elements or 
  external factors influencing the result.

1. Data Input
   - The Frontend game is sending ball's position (x,y) and velocity(x,y)
     to the backend every 1 sec.
   - example payload: {x: 400, y: 200, vx:5, vy:3, wall_x: 700, height: 400}
  	
//2. Model Architecture
	- train network to predict the ball's future y-position at the wall 
	- x = 0 and x = 500 are walls, y coordinates are AI's paddle position across wall
	
//3. Training
	- simulate many pong games, record (x,y, vx, vy) and the corresponding
	  y-position where the ball hits the wall
	  
4. Prediction
	- determine y-position of the collision on the wall based on data input.
	- determine future moves for next 1 minute (how many moves?)
	- The backend will send the AI paddle's target position to update the game.
	- response { y_collision: 250}

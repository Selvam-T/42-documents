ðŸŸ§ 	Run
	python3 -m http.server 8080 
  
  serves your Pong game's files 
  	(like index.html, pong.js, pong.css) 
  over HTTP.
    
  â€” It doesn't "create" the game logic 
  â€” it just hosts the files 
    so you can open http://localhost:8080 in your browser and 
    play the game.
    
ðŸŸ§	Open browser:
   	http://localhost:8080
   	
   	play game!!
   	
   	
ðŸŸ¢ Other open-source server options to replace python3 -m http.server:

	Node.js + http-server (npm install -g http-server)

	NGINX (super lightweight and powerful)

	Apache HTTP Server (heavier, but classic)

	Caddy (easy HTTPS by default)

	lighttpd (small and fast)

	serve (npm install -g serve â€” great for static sites)

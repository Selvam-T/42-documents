Implementing Advanced 3D Techniques (Frontend, with Backend support): 

Enhances the Pong game with advanced 3D graphics using Babylon.js for an immersive experience.

Nodes (Modules/Components):
---------------------------

> Advanced 3D Techniques (Frontend):
	Description: 
	Renders the Pong game with 3D graphics using Babylon.js, creating stunning visual effects 
	and an immersive UI.
	
	Implementation: 
	Frontend.

> Advanced 3D Techniques (Backend):
	Description: 
	Supports 3D gameplay by processing game state (e.g., ball/paddle positions) 
	and ensuring compatibility with Babylon.js rendering.

	Implementation: 
	Backend.
	
> Frontend Framework (Tailwind CSS + TypeScript):
	Description: 
	Provides the UI framework for integrating Babylon.js and styling non-3D elements 
	(e.g., menus, HUD).

	Implementation: 
	Frontend (from Web modules).
	
> Backend Framework (Fastify with Node.js):

	Description: 
	Provides APIs/WebSockets for real-time game state updates to support 3D gameplay.
	
	Implementation: 
	Backend (from Web modules).
	
> Database (SQLite):

	Description: 
	Stores game session data (e.g., match outcomes) linked to 3D gameplay.

	Implementation: 
	Backend (from Web modules).
	
> Standard User Management:

	Description: 
	Links user profiles to 3D game sessions (e.g., stats, history).

	Implementation: 
	Backend (from User Management modules).
	
> Remote Players/Multiple Players:

	Description: 
	Ensures 3D graphics support remote and multiplayer gameplay with synchronized visuals.

	Implementation: 
	Backend and Frontend (from Gameplay and User Experience modules).

> Game Customization Options:

	Description: 
	Applies customization (e.g., 3D maps, visual power-ups) to the 3D game.

	Implementation: 
	Backend and Frontend (from Gameplay and User Experience modules).
	
	
Connections (Interdependencies):
--------------------------------

> Advanced 3D Techniques (Frontend) â†’ Frontend Framework:
	The 3D graphics (Babylon.js) integrate with Tailwind CSS + TypeScript 
	for UI rendering (e.g., menus, HUD).
	
> Advanced 3D Techniques (Frontend) â†’ Advanced 3D Techniques (Backend):
	The frontend requests real-time game state (e.g., ball/paddle positions) from the 
	backend to render 3D visuals.
	
> Advanced 3D Techniques (Backend) â†’ Backend Framework:
	Uses Fastify APIs/WebSockets to process and send game state updates for 3D rendering.

> Advanced 3D Techniques (Backend) â†’ Database:
	Stores 3D game session outcomes (e.g., match results) in SQLite.

> Advanced 3D Techniques (Backend) â†’ Standard User Management:
	Links 3D game sessions to user profiles for stats and history tracking.

> Advanced 3D Techniques (Backend) â†’ Remote Players/Multiple Players:
	Ensures game state synchronization for remote/multiplayer 3D gameplay.

> Advanced 3D Techniques (Backend) â†’ Game Customization Options:
	Applies customization settings (e.g., 3D maps, visual power-ups) to the 3D game.

> Advanced 3D Techniques (Frontend) â†’ Game Customization Options:
	Renders customized 3D visuals (e.g., power-up effects, map designs) 
	based on user settings.

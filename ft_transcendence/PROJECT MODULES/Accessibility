	Description: 
	Supports SSR, language data, and browser-compatible APIs.

	Implementation: 
	Backend (from Web modules).
	
> Database (SQLite):
	Description: 
	Stores user language preferences and accessibility settings.
	
	Implementation: 
	Backend (from Web modules).

> Standard User Management:
	Description: 
	Links accessibility settings (e.g., language, text size) to user profiles.

	Implementation: 
	Backend (from User Management modules).

> Graphics (Advanced 3D Techniques):

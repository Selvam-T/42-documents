-	What is Volta?

	node

	npm

	CLI tools like typescript, eslint, etc.

	It ensures each project uses the exact tool versions it needs, automatically and cleanly.	

-	What problems on Linux will run I run into with out Volta on your machine?

	1) Wrong Node/NPM version:
	   Your system Node/NPM may be outdated or mismatched with project requirements.
	   
	2) Global version conflicts:
	   Switching between projects needing different Node versions becomes a mess.
	   
	3) Permission errors:
	   Installing global packages may require sudo, leading to potential system issues.
	   
	4) Missing npx or incorrect behavior:
	   Some versions of Node don’t bundle npx or have an older version.

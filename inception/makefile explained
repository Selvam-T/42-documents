Purpose of the Makefile in This Project:
---------------------------------------
'make' is a build automation tool program, works by reading Makefile.

The Makefile is a tool for automating tasks like running Docker Compose commands.
The developer can include additional checks and validations to ensure that 
everything is working correctly.
	
Makefile Structure:
------------------

1)	# Project Variables

execute docker-compose commands
2)	# build: 
		- executes the docker-compose build command
		- If the build fails, Docker Compose will exit with a non-zero status code, 
		- and the Makefile will stop at that point
		- validate if images were built

3)	# up: 
		- Start the services
		- I donot run clean: before up:
		
4)	# down:
		- Stop and remove services
		
5)	# clean:
		- Clean up containers, images, and volumes
		
6)	# logs:
		- Check logs
		
7)	# update:
		- Update images and rebuild
		- I do not down: the container can keep running.
		- the update comes into effect only if I stop and start

Diagnostics:
8)	# network:
	1) Displays networks
	2) Lists Containers and IP connected to custom network
	So in effect this test alone determines all containers are running 
	and connected to each other.
	
9)	# ping
	ping each other
	
Additional, combined with some commands above
		
1)	# check_volumes:

2)	# validate_container_configurations:

4) 	# Validate TLS settings in NGINX

1) Basic Dockerfile instructions explained in a) and b)

/******************************************************************/
# a) Part 1: instructions to create an image based on debian, install NGINX, and expose port 80
#    When you run command: docker build -t <image_name> .
#    a docker <image_name> will be created

FROM debian:bookworm

RUN apt update && apt upgrade -y

RUN apt install nginx -y

EXPOSE 80
#------------------------------------------------------------------#

# b) Part 2: when you start a container, it runs CMD from below
#    This happens when you run command: docker run -it image_name

CMD ["nginx", "-g" , "daemon off;"]

/******************************************************************/


2) How to run NGINX (web server) and connect from browser ?
   --------------------------------------------------------

	1) build docker image from docker file which exists in '.' root directory 
		docker built -t test .

	2) view docker image
		docker images
		
	3) create and run docker container from image
		docker run -it -p 8080:80 test

	4) view docker container
		docker ps
		
	5) from browser go to http://localhost:8080

	
3) About Dockerfile NGINX:
   -----------------------

Why change ownership 'chown' on /etc/nginx/ssl and /var/www/html folders in container?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- www-data is the Nginx default user
- Nginx typically drops root privilegesafter startup for safety
- therefore you give Nginx default user, www-data, to access files owned by root
- running as www-data limits damage if Nginx is compromised, instead of keeping root ownership

OpenSSL, ssl_protocols, Generating SSL certificates, HTTPS connection:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Along with nginx, I must install openssl
	- OpenSSL is a command line tool that can create and manage ssl certificates, keys.
	- OpenSSL is required to support TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 (ssl_protocols) 
	  by creating and managing certificates to serve HTTPS requests.
	- TLS is Transport Layer Security. Provides network communications security.
	
	- I must generate SSL certificates manually inside the container using OpenSSL?.
	- NGINX configuration will reference the certificate (nginx.crt) 
	  and private key (nginx.key) generated by OpenSSL to enable secure connection.
	- SSL certificates are essential for HTTPS, as they:
	  Authenticate the server, Enable encryption.
	  

	- Project requires that we restrict to TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 
	- By default NGINX has all TLS versions, so restrict to TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 in nginx.conf
	
	- NGINX will listen on port 443 for HTTPS traffic.
	- It will enforce TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3, rejecting older protocols.
	- It will use the SSL certificates specified to establish encrypted communication.
	- This will be specified in nginx.conf
	
refer to > https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html

	- The certificate files do not exist by default. 
	- It is generated by OpenSSL, as specified in Dockerfile

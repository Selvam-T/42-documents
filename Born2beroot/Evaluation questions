questions:

0)	signature
	cd sgoinfre/born2beroot
	shasum born2beroot2.vdi

1)	how a virtual machine works?
2)	choice of os
3)	rocky vs debian
4)	purpose of virtual machine
5)	aptitude vs apt
6)	monitoring.sh information to be displayed 10 mins

1a)	ensure machine does not have a graphicalenvironment at launch	
		dpkg -l | grep desktop-environment
		
		if not output, it suggests that Desktop environment that provides 
		GUI is not installed
		dpgk is a command for debian package manager
	
1b)	password required before attempting to connect

1c)	login must not be root
		root has highest level of privileges, to avoid mistakes with 
		severe consequences, avoid login in as root

1d)	password should follow the rules

2)	ufw service is started
		sudo ufw status			-->displays rules
		sudo systemctl status ufw	-->displays service currently running or not?
		
3)	ssh service is started
		sudo systemctl status ssh
		
4)	os is debian
		cat /etc/os-release	

user
1)	sthiagar is added to 1. 'sudo' and 2. 'user42' group?
		getent group sudo user42
2)	password policy implementation
		vim /etc/pam.d/common-password
		vim /etc/login.defs
3)	create new user, assign password, explain how files were modified to implement policy
		sudo adduser new_guy
		cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd  --> view only users
		
		sudo deluser new_guy
		
		sudo deluser new_guy new_group
		
		To remove user from a sudo group;
			edit sudoers file, sudo visudo, comment the username line
		
4)	create group 'evaluating', assign new user to this group
		sudo groupadd new_group
		sudo usermod -aG new_group new_guy
		
		getent group new_group
		sudo chage -l new_guy
		
		sudo groupdel new_group
		
5)	explain advantages/disadvantages of password policy
		disadvantages - user frustration, password management challenges
			lockout issues, limited security (multi-factor more secure)
			administrative overhead

hostname and partitions
1)	is hostname sthiagar42?
		hostname
2)	change hostname to newuser, reboot, check hostname is updated
		sudo hostnamectl set-hostname new_hostname
		sudo reboot
3)	restore hostname to sthiagar42
		sudo hostnamectl set-hostname sthiagar42
		sudo reboot
4)	view pastitions
		lsblk
5)	is partition similar? (don't have to be, not doing bonus)
6)	explain how LVM works
		Logical Volume Manager
		PVs - Physical Volume
		VGs - Volume Groups
		LGs - Logical Volumes

sudo
1)	sudo installed?
		dpkg -l | grep sudo	-->debian package -list
		
		example of a service I didn't install, firefox
		dpkg -l | grep firefox
		
2)	assign new user to 'sudo' group
		sudo usermod -aG sudo new_guy
		update sudoers file, add line: username ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
		
		sudo -lU username  -->check if user is part of sudo group		
		
3)	explain value and operation of sudo using example
		example of using directive: mail_badpass
		value - enhance security, detect unauthorized access attempts
		operation - when directive enabled, email notification sent to sudo user
		
4)	implementation of rules imposed
		edit the sudoer files to add rules.
		User-sepcific rule, john ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
		Group-sepcific rule, %group1 ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
		
5)	/var/log/sudo/ folder exists? has file? see history of commands used with sudo
		ls /var/log/sudo/sudo.log
6)	run command with sudo, see if file updated
		cat /var/log/sudo/sudo.log

ufw/firewall
1)	ufw installed? ufw working?
		sudo ufw status
2)	what is ufw? value of using it?
		ufw is ubuntu and debian based command-line tool for managing firewall iptables
		simplicity and user-friendliness, to quickly setup and manage a firewall
3)	list active rules in ufw, a rule must exist for port 4242
		sudo ufw status	
		notice status is active, port 4242 ALLOW
4)	add a new rule to open port 8080, check this is added by listing active rules
		sudo ufw allow 8080
5)	delete the new rule for 8080
		sudo ufw delete allow 8080

SSH
1)	SSH installed? working properly?
		sudo service sshd status
2)	what is SSH? value of using it?
		Secure Shell Host, network protocol used for remote access
		secure file transfer, secure remote login
3)	SSH service only uses port 4242
		update /etc/ssh/sshd_config -->change port 22 to 4242
		sudo systemctl restart ssh
4)	login with new user using SSH?
5)	should not be able to login with root user using SSH

script monitoring
1)	how script works, show code
		cat /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh
2)	what is "cron"
		crontab command is used to manage and schedule tasks run at specific times
3)	how does the script run every 10 minutes from when the server starts
		sudo crontab -u root -e -->edit the crontab of root user
4)	run every minute
		sudo crontab -u root -e
		*/1 * * * * /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh
5)	make the script stop running when server rebooted, without modifying the script
		sudo /etc/init.d/cron stop
		however it will halt all scheduled jobs until you start it again
	
		sudo /etc/init.d/cron start

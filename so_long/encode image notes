3,	but before that, resize png to 50 X 50 pixel

	first string is "98 100 7779 2"
	98 pixels wide
	100 pixels high
	7779 colors that appear
	2 I don't know

7,	the next 7779 strings define the color
	";  c #FFF59E"
	first character pair is ;+<space> encodes RGB color represented by #FFF59E
	look for RGB color codes on the internet, not essential
